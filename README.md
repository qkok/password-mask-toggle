# password-mask-toggle-ng

A custom password input component that can toggle between a password mask and plain text

## Getting started

### Usage

* Add the *custom-password-input* component files to your project's *src/app* folder
* Import the *CustomPasswordInputComponent* into your desired module and add it to the module's *declarations* array
* Add the component to your template by using the *app-custom-password-input* selector

### Dependencies
Font-Awesome is used for the button's icons. It is linked to directly in the component's html file. This can be removed if your project already has a Font-Awesome import.
